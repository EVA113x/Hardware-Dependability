#### Controllability measurements
1. Testability 
2. Need approximate measure of
   1. Difficulty of setting internal circuit lines to 0 or 1 by setting primary circuit inputs
   2. Difficulty of observing internal circuit lines by observing primary outputs
3. Use
   1.  Analysis of difficulty of testing internal circuit parts: redesign or add special test hardware
   2.  Guidance for algorithms computing test patterns: avoid using hard-to-control lines
   3.  Estimation of fault coverage and test vector length
4. Circuit Topological analysis
5. Computational complexity

#### Controllability measurements: SCOAP controllability

##### SCOAP 
1. Sandia Controllability and Observability Analysis Program
2. Six numerical measures 
##### Combinational measures:
1. CC0 – Difficulty of setting circuit line to logic 0
   1. If a logic gate output is produced by setting only one input to a controlling value, then:$\color{blue}{output controllability = min ( input controllabilities) + 1}$
2. CC1 – Difficulty of setting circuit line to logic 1
3. CO – Difficulty of observing a circuit line
##### Range 
1. Controllabilities: 1 (easiest = PI) to infinity(hardest)
2. Observabilities: 0 (easiest = PO) to infinity(hardest)
3. Measures roughly proportional to # of circuit lines that must be set to control or observe given
line

##### AND gates Output 0 controllability
1. output_controllability = min (input_controllabilities) + 1
2. Example: two input AND
   CC0(z) = min(CC0(a), CC0(b)) + 1

##### AND gate Output 1 controllability
1. output_controllability = sum(input_controllabilities) + 1
2. Example: two input XOR
   CC0(z) = min[(CC0(a)+CC0(b))，(CC1(a) + CC1(b)) ] +1

##### XOR gate Output controllability
1. output_controllability = min(input_controllabilities) + 1
2. two input XOR. CC0(z) = min[(CC0(a) + CC0(b)),(CC1(a) + CC1(b))] + 1

##### To observe a gate input
1. Set observability difficult CO of PO (for both 0 & 1)
2. Observability is comptuted in reverse order starting at PO and moving backwards to PI

##### The CO of an input of a gate is equal to:

1. The observablity of its output, plus.
   
2. The difficulty of setting all other inputs to non-controlling values,
    
3. plus 1(to account for logic depth)
