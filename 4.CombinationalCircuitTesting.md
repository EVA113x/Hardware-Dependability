## Main Content
### Fault smulation
#### Purpose
1. Deal with the behavior of fabricated circuit
2. Determine the test quality(product quality)
3. Development of manufacturing test program
#### Input 
1. A circuit
2. A sequence of test vectors
3. Fault model(s)
#### Output 
1. Fault coverage(FC): Fraction detected faults by test vectors
2. Set of undetected faults
3. (identify vectors without any added value)
4. (With help of other programs, it can generate the rquired min test set for a given FC)
