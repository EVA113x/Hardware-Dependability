## Target
1. Describe the sequence circuit testing problem    
2. Describe the different methods used for seq ATPG
3. Apply TFEM to generate test vectors for seq circuits

### Keywords:
 #### ATPG:
   (acronym for both Automatic Test Pattern Generation and Automatic Test Pattern Generator) is an electronic design automation method or technology used to find an input (or test) sequence that, when applied to a digital circuit, enables automatic test equipment to distinguish between the correct circuit behavior and the faulty circuit behavior caused by defects.
   ##### Properties
   1. Operation on digital hardware structure(no need to know the functionality)
   2. Use a targeted fault set of fault model(s)
   3. Inject fault into circuit modeled in computer/netlist
   4. Initialized the circuit to a known state
   5. Activates the fault 
   6. Propagateds the fault effect to a primary output
   ##### Inputs
   1. Gate-level netlist: network of library cells, Flip flops, and their interconnects
   2. Fault list: loccation in netlist, local activation conditons, local fault effect
   3. Testablility measurements: SCO, SC1, S0
      1. SCO:
      2. SC1:
      3. S0
   ##### Outputs
   1. List of test pattern
   2. Fault coverage
#### SAF(Stuck-At-Fault) model:
a type of fault model used in digital circuit testing and Design for Testability (DFT) techniques. 
In this model, it is assumed that a single logic gate in the circuit is permanently stuck at a logical 0 or 1, regardless of the input signal applied to it.
