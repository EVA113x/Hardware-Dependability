## Testability
### Definition
The ability of SYNTHESIZE, GENERATE, EVALUATE, APPLY and OBSERVE tests to satisfy -
1. A range of predetermined objectives(eg. Fault coverage, Defect level, Time-to Volume)
2. Subject to two fundamental constraint: Time and Money
### Reason(why Test is indispensable)
1. Motivation: Quality
2. Manufacturing process is complicted & time consuming
    1. Defect is inevitable
    2. Origin silicon: e.g, impurities, dislocations
    3. Manufacturing process: process variation, temperature fluctuations , opens, shorts, extra/missing transistors, spot defect, etc.
3. Soft faults (in-field faults)
   1. Increase speed and noise margin reduction reduce robustness
   2. Nanimeter technologies sensitive to radiation(at sea level)
#### Driving factors:
1. Time to market(Predictability, Reliability)
2. Quality
3. Cost
### Comparision

#### Testing versus verification
##### Design synthesis
Give an I/O function, develop a procedure to mabufacture a device using known materials and processed.
##### Verification
Predictive analysis to ensure that thr synthesized design, when manufactured, will perform the given I/O function[after development]
1. Verifies correctness of design (terget design errors)
2. Performed by simulation, hardware emulation, or formal methods 
3. Performed once prior to manufacturing
4. Responsible to quality of design
5. Some design errors are only found in real silicon(Design validation- post - silicon)
##### Test
A manufacturing step that ensures that the physical device, manufactured from the synthesized design, has no manufacturing defect[after manufacturing]
1. Verifies correctness of manufactured IC (target manufacturing defects)
2. Two-part process:
3. Test generation: software process executed once during design
4. Test application: electrical tests applied to hardware
5. Test application performed on every manufactured device
6. Responsible for quality of devices
