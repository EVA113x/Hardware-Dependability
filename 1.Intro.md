## Testability
### Definition
The ability of SYNTHESIZE, GENERATE, EVALUATE, APPLY and OBSERVE tests to satisfy -
1. A range of predetermined objectives(eg. Fault coverage, Defect level, Time-to Volume)
2. Subject to two fundamental constraint: Time and Money
### Reason(why Test is indispensable)
1. Motivation: Quality
2. Manufacturing process is complicted & time consuming
    1. Defect is inevitable
    2. Origin silicon: e.g, impurities, dislocations
    3. Manufacturing process: process variation, temperature fluctuations , opens, shorts, extra/missing transistors, spot defect, etc.
3. Soft faults (in-field faults)
   1. Increase speed and noise margin reduction reduce robustness
   2. Nanimeter technologies sensitive to radiation(at sea level)
#### Driving factors:
1. Time to market(Predictability, Reliability)
2. Quality
3. Cost
### Comparision

#### Testing versus verification
##### Design synthesis
Give an I/O function, develop a procedure to mabufacture a device using known materials and processed.
##### Verification[1]
Predictive analysis to ensure that thr synthesized design, when manufactured, will perform the given I/O function[after development]
1. Verifies correctness of design (terget design errors)
2. Performed by simulation, hardware emulation, or formal methods 
3. Performed once prior to manufacturing
4. Responsible to quality of design
5. Some design errors are only found in real silicon(Design validation- post - silicon)
##### Test[2]
A manufacturing step that ensures that the physical device, manufactured from the synthesized design, has no manufacturing defect[after manufacturing]
1. Verifies correctness of manufactured IC (target manufacturing defects)
2. Two-part process:
3. Test generation: software process executed once during design
4. Test application: electrical tests applied to hardware
5. Test application performed on every manufactured device
6. Responsible for quality of devices 
## Quality
![image text](https://github.com/EVA113x/Hardware-Dependability/blob/main/image/timeline.png)
Meet the expectation of the customer
1. Guarantee that the IC performs its function at t=0
2. Conformance to specifications: time-independent
3. Measured in DPM (defects part per million)
4. Driven by defect/fault coverage & performance guard-bands
5. Impacts B2B(business to business) relationship
## Reliability
1. Guarantee that the IC performs its function for t>= Time(lifetime) > 0
2. Meeting specification over time : time-dependent
3. Measured in FIT(Failure rate in Failures in 10^9 device -operating hours)
4. Driven by changing material properties, application profile, environment,..
5. Impacts C2B(Consumer-to-business) relationship
## Ideal and Real test
1. Ideal test:
• Detect all defects produced in the design and/or manufacturing
• Pass all functionally good devices
• Fail all functionally bad devices
• Detect all reliability related defects
2. Real test
• Very large number of possible defects need to be tested
• Difficult to generate tests for some real defects
• Based on analyzable fault models
• Incomplete coverage of modeled faults due to complexity/cost
• Some good chips are rejected(yield loss)
• Some bad chips pass(escapes/ defect level in DefectPerMillion DPM)
### Yield
Some good chips are rejected(cost)
### Escape
Some bad chips are passed(cost)
#### Reason:
1. Timing related defects
• Complete timing testing impractical
• Increased speed makes circuits more sensitive to smaller delays
2. Un-modeled faults/Untested faults
• Not all faulty behavior identified and modeled
• Test time limitations
3. Circuit/process sensitivities
• Design not verified over complete range of specifications
4. Environmental failures
• Failures at specific temperatures and/or voltages
• Noise related failures/ signal integrity
5. Non-environmental failures
• Fast degradation of IC parameters, timing sensitivity increases with each technology generation
## DPPM?
## FIT(Failure In Time)
## Testing Cost
### DFT(Design-For-Test)
Design techniques that make test generation, test application and
test evaluation cost-effective

Each component of electronic systems require specific DFT. However, component level-DFT is not sufficient for system test.
### Software processes of test
• Test generation and fault simulation
• Test programming and debugging
### Manufacturing test
• Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) capital cost
• Test center operational cost
